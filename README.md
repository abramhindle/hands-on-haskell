This was a hands on tutorial given to EFPUG on 2013-05-06, you can
follow the git checkouts to see the order in which the stuff was
given.

So follow along the commits and check them out, riff on the example
code and make some new code. This is only really effective if it is
hands-on. You need to eval the code and try it out. 

Use ghci.
